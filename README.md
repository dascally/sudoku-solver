# Sudoku Solver

This is a simple sudoku solver app. Enter a sudoku puzzle, hit solve, and see the solution. It also stores a local history of puzzles you've asked it to solve.

The sudoku solver algorithm is inspired by the discussion of backtracking and sudoku in _The Algorithm Design Manual_ by Steven S. Skiena, but I implemented it from scratch.
